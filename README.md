## Structured State Space Models

This repository contains the implementation of **Structured State Space Models** as part of the final project for the course _Development Tools for Scientific Computing_ held at SISSA during the academic year 2024–2025.

Please, find here the [project report](report.md). 

**Authors**: @FilippoOlivo, @GiovanniCanali.

### Project Description

**State Space Models (SSMs)** are an emerging class of deep learning architectures that have demonstrated significant promise in the domain of sequence modeling. These models have recently established state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as time series forecasting and audio generation, outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

This project investigates **structured variants of SSMs** with a focus on computational efficiency and scalability. The following architectures are implemented and evaluated:

- **S4**
- **S6**
- **Gated MLP**
- **Mamba**

The primary objective is to perform a comparative analysis of the aforementioned models based on the following criteria: accuracy, training time, memory consumption.

To ensure consistency and relevance, the evaluation is conducted on synthetic sequence modeling tasks, including
copy task, and selective copy task. These tasks serve as controlled benchmarks to assess the models' ability to retain and manipulate sequential information over long contexts.


### Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository and navigate into it:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilippoOlivo/SSM.git
cd SSM
```

2. **Create a Conda environment with Python:**

```bash
conda create --name ssm-env python=3.12 -y
```

3. **Activate the environment:**

```bash
conda activate ssm-env
```

4. **Install the package:**

```bash
python -m pip install .
```
